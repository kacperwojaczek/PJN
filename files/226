Resident Evil: Retribution
5.4
AdvertisementBy JEANNETTE CATSOULISThe fifth entry in a series as indestructible as Alice (Not wearying at all of Ms. Jovovich’s eternally moving parts, the director, Paul W. S. Anderson (who wrote all five installments and has directed three), this time strips his leading lady of her superpowers and, by way of consolation, reunites her with previously terminated characters. (Whether you’ve been sushi’d by a laser or blown up by an atom bomb, Mr. Anderson will find a way to resurrect you, usually with even fewer facial expressions than before.)He also supplies Alice with a daughter — cribbing shamelessly from “Aliens” — and an alternate suburban reality that ends abruptly when zombie hordes invade her laundry room. Just try explaining that to Sears.Taking place almost entirely inside computer-simulated global locations, “Retribution” moves closer than ever to its airless video game roots. Ms. Jovovich may possess a limited acting vocabulary, but her body has a language all its own. Perhaps we should say bodies: once again, we have multiple Alices, all in dire need of new wardrobes. A zombie plague may have laid waste the world, but apparently supplies of black leather unitards have yet to be exhausted.“Resident Evil: Retribution” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Evisceration by chain saw and suffocation by licking monster, which sounds a lot more fun than it looks.
