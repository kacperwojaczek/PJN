[REC]3 Genesis
5.0
AdvertisementBy JEANNETTE CATSOULIS“[REC] 3: Genesis,”Retained, along with the seat-of-the-pants photography, is the series’s trademark rage-inducing virus (whose origin, despite the film’s title, remains unexplained). This time the sickness erupts at the lavish nuptials of Clara (Leticia Dolera) and Koldo (Diego Martín), borne by a portly uncle whose bite from a diseased dog soon has him chomping lustily on the other guests. Bloodshot eyes, Confined by the script to a luxury villa and its leafy grounds, the separated newlyweds fight to reconnect amid the sea of flesh eaters who were once family and friends. Using multiple cameras (it’s a wedding, after all), Mr. Plaza trashes most of them, usually beneath the shuffling feet of his extras. At those times the screen momentarily goes black; but the gray-green security images that pick up the slack also amp up the horror, linking us to the earlier films and reminding us of the power of a fixed gaze.With slapstick smothering the scares, “[REC 3]” is further marred by a plot in which the muted Catholicism of its antecedents is turned up to full blast. Even so, the inclusion of several versions of Barry Ryan’s terrific 1968 hit, “[REC] 3: Genesis” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Holy terror and unholy matrimony.
