Project X
6.7
AdvertisementBy NEIL GENZLINGERThe Oscars are swell, but once in a while a film comes along that is so courageous it deserves consideration for the The birthday boy in question is Thomas (Thomas Mann), whose parents apparently missed the chapter in the Child-Rearing Bible about never leaving your teenager home alone for a weekend. “This is Thomas we’re talking about,” Dad explains to Mom to put her mind at ease. “He’s not exactly Mr. Popular.”But Thomas’s pal Costa sees the unsupervised weekend as an opportunity to put himself, Thomas and their friend J. B. (Jonathan Daniel Brown) on the high school cool-crowd map. He engineers an over-the-top birthday party for Thomas that slides into pure chaos. Forget those other teenage-party movies you’ve experienced; in this one the beer pong scene is the most dignified moment.Nima Nourizadeh, the director, puts three relative unknowns in the central roles, and it pays off, especially with Oliver Cooper, who gives Costa a mischievous likability that anchors the enterprise. Also smart: the boys bring along a video geek (Dax Flame) to film the whole thing, which gives Mr. Nourizadeh a lot of viewpoint options. He also has assorted cameras in the midst of the party, a funny script and some skilled editors cutting it all together. The “Project X” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian)





Opens on Friday nationwide.
Directed by Nima Nourizadeh
