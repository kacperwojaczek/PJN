Chinese Zodiac
6.2
AdvertisementBy ANDY WEBSTERThere was an amusing Saturday morning cartoon series in the early 2000s, After an opening chase scene and a brief segment dense with exposition — about statues stolen long ago from China by Western invaders — we follow a treasure hunter for hire, J C (Mr. Chan), and his young team (Kwon Sang-woo, Liao Fan and Zhang Lanxin) on a quest for the missing pieces. In tow are an archaeologist (Yao Xingtong) and a French heiress (Laura Weissbecker), while J C’s antagonists include his scurrilous employer (Oliver Platt) and an artifact-seeking rival (Alaa Safi).There are scattered subplots — primarily one about activists petitioning for the repatriation of art — but mostly the film is about exotic locations (including a volcano), garish humor (often at the expense of Mr. Chan or women), fisticuffs, stunts and frenetic visual bombast. As usual in his movies, the closing credits feature outtakes revealing injuries he sustained during shooting. Mr. Chan is almost 60; “Chinese Zodiac” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for almost bloodless action.





Opens on Friday.
Directed by Jackie Chan
