                Pierre Coffin and Kyle Balda put a lot of film history into their conception of the third installment in a successful animated franchise.            That similarity extends to the story, which finds the minions — who, as their names and coloring suggest, usually play second banana — now getting their own origin story and a shot at being the stars of the show, like their franchise brethren Batman and Spider-Man. The good news is that the minions are more (unconsciously, if perhaps also strategically) in touch with their anarchic side than the typical onesie-wearing crusader, which suits the directors Pierre Coffin and Kyle Balda’s well-tuned sense of the absurd. That’s never more delightfully expressed than in the opener, in which the minions swarm and bumble across the ages from one poorly served villainous boss to the next.Soon enough, though, the minions end up unhappy together in a cave because, as the narrator (Geoffrey Rush) explains, “without a master they had no purpose.” Marxists and parents may raise some bushy eyebrows in protest, but the movie’s ideological underpinning and its master-slave dynamic are so self-consciously incoherent that outrage feels beside the point (or just pointless). The minions may live to slave for a master, but they often, as their initial efforts at servitude illustrate, do so badly. Like Charlie Chaplin’s assembly line worker in “Modern Times,” who’s swept up in the well-oiled gears of capitalism, the minions keep mucking up the machinery with their labor.The Times critic Manohla Dargis reviews “Minions.”Well, actually, three stooging minions — Kevin, Stuart and Bob — “Minions” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested.) Gun and heavy-artillery violence.
