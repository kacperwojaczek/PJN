The Last of Robin Hood
5.7
AdvertisementBy NICOLAS RAPOLD“The Last of Robin Hood”The film’s directors, Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland, frame their oddly placid story as a recounting of this real-life tale by Florence Aadland (Susan Sarandon), Beverly’s daffily showbiz-obsessed mother, to a ghostwriter after Flynn’s death in 1959, at just 50.And, as we watch, a mutually escapist, if illicit, romance develops between Flynn and Beverly, who’s enjoying a respite from having been stage-managed since birth, but the biggest presence in the room is the filmmakers’ vision of 1950s mores and habits of denial.That approach might make this gently and fondly rendered movie sound more serious than it is, and a tropicália score shuffles on incessantly in the background, as if to ensure that things won’t get too heavy. Beverly’s self-deluding, and flattered, perspective serves as a potent filter. Between that and Mr. Kline’s conviviality, the story comes to feel mild (and incomplete) in its tempered nostalgia. “The Last of Robin Hood” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for some sexuality and language.
