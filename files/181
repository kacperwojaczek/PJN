5.0

She also briefly interacts with, yes, actors, many of whom (Deborah Kara Unger, Malcolm McDowell, Carrie-Anne Moss) deserve much, much better.The film is nothing if not liberal with its bloodletting, which integrates cleverly at times with the 3-D: lopped fingers, for example, fly toward the audience.
