AdvertisementBy A. O. SCOTTThe Times critic A. O. Scott reviews “Spy.”In “But this movie, written and directed by And why not? The busy, silly script allows Ms. McCarthy to be her own best sidekick, in effect an entire sketch-comedy troupe unto herself. She starts out as Susan Cooper, a mousy, cheerful desk jockey at C.I.A. headquarters where, despite her training and her status as a full-fledged officer, she is ignored and belittled. Her job is to be the eyes and ears of Bradley Fine (Mr. Law), a glamorous would-be 007 who relies on Susan’s expertise and toys with her feelings.A preview of the film.Susan is anxious, awkward and eager to please, her intelligence and competence in perpetual struggle with her low self-esteem. Once in the field, though, she undergoes a transformation that is all the more entertaining because it doesn’t quite make sense. Rebelling against the typecasting of her undercover identities — a Midwestern cat enthusiast, a bedraggled single mom — Susan reinvents herself as an elegant espionage artiste. Instructed to observe and report on the doings of a Bulgarian arms dealer (Ms. Byrne), she goes rogue in every imaginable way and proves herself adept at fighting second-string femmes fatales and random dark-suited minions, as well as flying planes and conducting high-speed chases through European cities.Along the way she tangles with Mr. Statham’s character, an arrogant peacock who brags about exploits that sound like outtakes from Melissa McCarthy and Miranda Hart in a scene from the film.This movie is fancier than “The Heat” or “Even better is the blithe feminism that makes “Spy” feel at once revolutionary and like no big deal. It’s not just that the movie aces the “Spy” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Salty and bloody.
