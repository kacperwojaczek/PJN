AdvertisementBy ANDY WEBSTERZhou Shen and Liu Lu’s bleak farce “A preview of the film.In 1942, a struggling school in rural China needs money. The faculty members, an agreeable if fractious lot, each have psychological baggage: Zhang Yiman (Ren Suxi) is blithely laissez-faire about sex; Pei Kuishan (played by an actor with the same name) has sensitive digestion; Zhou Tienan (Liu Shuailiang) is a righteous hothead; and the dean, Sun Henghai (Da Li), is trying to preserve his institution while raising his 15-year-old daughter, Jia (Bu Guanjin). A pending visit from a severe education commissioner (Han Yanbo) prompts the group to pressure an illiterate coppersmith (A Runa) into masquerading as an English teacher — the title character — to impress the official and secure funds. Enter antic pandemonium.When the commissioner brings along a sympathetic American philanthropist providing the financing, we discover the official’s own baggage: a habit of skimming money. (Not embezzlement, his secretary says, “the optimal allocation of resources.”)The second act is grim, as humiliations imposed by the commissioner, enraged by the ruse, exact a toll. Tienan’s defiance is broken; Yiman is verbally abused and, shorn of her hair, neutered. Like Ophelia in “Hamlet” (partly performed for the commissioner), she grows unhinged. Knowing the winning charisma and bracing independence Ms. Ren has manifested up to then, we feel Yiman’s pain, and by the end even more so.
