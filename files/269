This time relatives of those traffickers want vengeance for those killed during the one-man rescue conducted by her father, Bryan (The family makes it easy for the villains by taking an impromptu trip to Istanbul, where Bryan and Lenore are promptly snatched. (Albanian crime lords have a long reach and many connections in passport offices and such.) It falls to Kim to initiate their rescue. Doing so requires her to, among other things, set off hand grenades in the middle of the city, something that causes surprisingly little concern among the populace.What follows seems like a nonstop car and foot chase, with Albanian after Albanian falling victim to Bryan’s remarkable aim and hand-fighting skills. Foreigners bad, Americans good, box office busy.“Taken 2” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for many dead Albanians.
