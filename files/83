Louise Bourgeois: The Spider, the Mistress and the Tangerine

AdvertisementBy NATHAN LEEFrom an art historical perspective, the work of A true (and sometimes terrifying) original, Ms. Bourgeois, now 96, is more than the sum of her parts. The uncommonly elegant and evocative portrait “Louise Bourgeois: The Spider, the Mistress and the Tangerine” reveals much about this haunting and haunted master while leaving intact what Georges Braque once wrote was the only thing that mattered in art: the thing you cannot explain.At Ms. Bourgeois’s Brooklyn studio, the filmmakers Marion Cajori and Amei Wallach attend to her  rambling, entrancing ruminations on the archetype of “the runaway girl”; the necessity of silence; and the power of fear and the primacy of memory in her work  —  of the mangled bodies of World War I  veterans, of her mother twisting fabrics in a stream, of abandonment, of dreams.LOUISE BOURGEOISThe Spider, the Mistress and the TangerineOpens on Wednesday in Manhattan. Produced and directed by Marion Cajori and Amei Wallach; directors of photography, Mead Hunt and Ken Kobland; edited by Mr. Kobland; released by Art Kaleidoscope Foundation.
