Dumb and Dumber To
5.7
AdvertisementBy MANOHLA DARGISIn But “Dumb and Dumber,” which presented itself as an invigorating blast of odorous fun, earned its laughs partly because it didn’t soften its no-frills absurdity and heartburning guff about life being a box of chocolates. Mostly, it delighted by giving Mr. Carrey, after his “Ace Ventura” success, the chance to run wild with his rubber-band physiognomy and gift for squirming comedy. (Few comics can shove a laugh back down an audience’s throat as quickly.) Both he and Mr. Daniels have slowed down without cleaning up their act.To that end, as it were, this sequel is just, uh, packed, or perhaps smeared, with a whole lot of poop jokes. There are diaper gags, lots of them, mostly pretty funny, and a couple of peekaboo looks at a feline rear end. That same puss ends up swinging from a chandelier, which in another movie might be the center of an elaborately staged set but here feels like an easy throwaway. The Farrellys are still not much interested in film as a visual medium, and when Lloyd and Harry aren’t smacking each other or dropping their pants, you might as well be listening to a radio play. There’s a story, but it doesn’t matter, certainly not to the leads or the good-natured sidekicks like “Dumb and Dumber To” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) because of course it is.
