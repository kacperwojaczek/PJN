Chocolate

AdvertisementBy NATHAN LEE“Chocolate”It’s true that Zen (Jija Yanin Vismitananda), born to a humble Thai woman and a Japanese gangster, exhibits behaviors that suggest autism, or at least some poorly acted simulation of it: abnormal shyness, primitive syntax, rocking back and forth, an extreme aversion to houseflies.Fortunately, she has been endowed with a natural mastery of the martial arts, much of which she appears to absorb by watching Risibly sentimental even for a genre not known for its emotional sophistication, “Chocolate” follows Zen as she collects on debts owed her ailing mother in order to pay for medical care. (You  hope her targets have paid up their own premiums.)
