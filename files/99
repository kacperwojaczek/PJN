Angels In Stardust
5.4
AdvertisementBy NEIL GENZLINGER“Angels in Stardust”The family lives in a tattered Oklahoma community surrounding a dead drive-in theater, though it’s still alive, in a sense, for Vallie Sue. She holds imaginary conversations with a cowboy (Billy Burke), who materializes on the beat-up screen and gives her cryptic advice. That’s more than she gets from her mother, Tammy, who had Vallie Sue and her kid brother at a young age and is now wantonly trying to land a husband before her looks go. The neighborhood includes a couple of ruffians and a somewhat mysterious Indian named Tenkill (Michael Spears).The film was written and directed by William Robert Carey, who gives his main character and her town a feel perhaps more suited to a time when drive-ins were thriving. Vallie Sue, who has a vivid imagination and wants to be a writer, is an unconvincing combination of naïve and smart. And the story’s threads and themes all conspire a little too conveniently to tell her that there is a bigger world out there somewhere. But Ms. Michalka (who is also a “Angels in Stardust” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for sporadic sexual references.
