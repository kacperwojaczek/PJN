Never Back Down
6.6
AdvertisementBy JEANNETTE CATSOULISA Setting the tone immediately, this lunkheaded film by Jeff Wadlow opens with a brawl, from which we gather that the instigator, the Iowa teenager Jake Tyler (Sean Faris), has never heard of anger management. This will become an asset when the family moves to Florida to further the tennis aspirations of Jake’s younger brother (a delightful Wyatt Smith). Enrolled in a high school where social status is determined by the ability to render peers unconscious with your bare hands, Jake finally discovers the therapeutic benefits of breaking faces.Manifesting all the nuance and insight of a music video, “Never Back Down” plays like a pop-psychology seminar on fathers and sons. As Jake, his schoolyard nemesis (Cam Gigandet) and his martial-arts mentor (a slumming Djimon Hounsou) work out their daddy issues on one another, the movie speeds up and slows down as though controlled by a director in the grip of competing medications. For those who make it to the final beatdown, however, the only pill worth taking is the one that makes you forget.NEVER BACK DOWNOpens on Friday nationwide.
