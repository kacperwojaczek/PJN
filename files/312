The largely faithful  adaptation, written and directed by Chen Daming,  is in some ways cruder  than the original but strips away most of its sexiness and all of its  sex. Where the American, Nick, used his powers to make himself better in  bed, his Chinese counterpart, Sun Zi Gang,  uses them to make himself a  better dinner companion. Not only do we never see Mr. Lau in bed with a  woman, we also never see him in a bedroom with a woman.The increased conservatism comes hand in hand with an even more  deadly moralism, including a new filial-piety subplot. The real victim   is Ms. Gong, whose character, Yi-Long, has been given an additional love  interest, one of several tweaks that reduce her independence and  decisiveness. Ms. Gong’s  hauteur and great blank beauty  — perfect for  scheming queens and tragic concubines  — don’t generate much sympathy,  and Yi-Long ends up seeming cold and more than a little pathetic.
