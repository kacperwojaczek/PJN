Finding Babel

AdvertisementBy BEN KENIGSBERG“Finding Babel”Some of the drier travelogue material is better-suited to a podcast. Even so, the director, David Novack, tries to give viewers a sense of Babel’s prose style. In a voice-over, Liev Schreiber reads excerpts accompanied by montages and animation. We also see pieces of the 1926 film “Benya Krik,” for which Babel wrote the screenplay.A preview of the film.Another fascinating figure in the documentary is Babel’s widow, Antonina Pirozhkova, who died in 2010 and who had worked as an engineer designing subway stations in Moscow.At its most engaging, “Finding Babel” doubles as literary criticism, as when Mr. Malaev-Babel rehearses his grandfather’s play “Maria” with actors in Paris — he meets with Marina Vlady, the star of Jean-Luc Godard’s “2 or 3 Things I Know About Her” — and teases out the drama’s political themes. Late in the film, there is a powerful moment when he visits the site of Babel’s arrest.In what probably qualifies as both an accomplishment and a shortcoming, the movie makes you want to read Babel’s writing instead.
