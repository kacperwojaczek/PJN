Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials
6.4
AdvertisementBy JOHN WILLIAMSScience doesn’t yet know how many movies it will take to answer this century’s most pressing question: How will attractive teenagers survive the apocalypse?“Thomas discovers that Janson is stringing kids up, unconscious and riddled with tubes, for some reason related to the virus. That’s enough info for him to grab his friends and skedaddle. Their unlikely jailbreak sends them blinking into a blasted landscape of ruined skyscrapers and giant sand dunes, like some combination of Tatooine and Detroit, where they hope to survive long enough to find a fabled group of resistance fighters.“The Scorch Trials” adds nothing new to the unkillable dystopian genre, but it’s at least less ponderous than its “What do we do now?” a weary character asks near the end. With one last rousing speech from Thomas, that’s obvious: Make a third movie, due in 2017.“Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Occasional gun violence and fewer bad words than you would utter under similar duress.
