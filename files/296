Horrible Bosses 2

AdvertisementBy STEPHEN HOLDEN“Horrible Bosses 2,”This disgracefully slapdash farce, directed by Sean Anders from a screenplay he wrote with John Morris, brings back many of the same stars from the first film in token appearances to try to maintain an illusion of continuity. But the story doesn’t even try to make sense. You often have the queasy feeling that the screenplay was improvised on the spot.To refresh your memory, the original Most of the humor in “Horrible Bosses” revolved around extreme caricatures embodied by Jennifer Aniston and Kevin Spacey. Ms. Aniston’s Dr. Julia Harris, a sexually insatiable dentist who molested her male patients while they were under anesthesia and verbally and physically harassed her soon-to-be-married assistant (Mr. Day), has returned with her potty mouth intact. As cheerfully raunchy as ever, she now runs a 12-step program for sex addicts that she uses to recruit partners. Ms. Aniston still brings a twinkling levity to a role that in less capable hands would be a hateful gorgon. But the novelty of a beautiful woman aggressively harassing a male underling has faded.AdvertisementLast time around, Mr. Spacey’s character carried the cruelty of Buddy Ackerman, his movie producer in Top dog among the new baddies is Bert Hanson (Christoph Waltz, miscast), a sadistic retail mogul who agrees to bankroll the triumvirate’s new invention, a bathroom accessory called the shower buddy, only to betray them. Bert has a spoiled, sociopathic son from hell (Chris Pine), whom the inventors kidnap and hold for ransom.What “Horrible Bosses 2” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for crude sexual content and language.
