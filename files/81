The Looking Glass
6.6
AdvertisementBy GLENN KENNYThe actress Dorothy Tristan returns to the screen after a nearly 30-year absence in ““The Looking Glass” is set and was shot in LaPorte County in Indiana, where Ms. Tristan and Mr. Hancock live, and the movie has a bit of a homespun feel. Its story concerns an aged onetime actress (Ms. Tristan) who is looking after and mentoring her displaced and emotionally scarred 13-year-old granddaughter (Grace Tarnow). The film teems with overfamiliar commonplaces (the looming debilitation inherent in aging, the metaphor of an unseen neighbor’s sorely neglected dog, and so on) as it saunters to its climax, at an elaborate local production of David Del Tredici’s symphony “Final Alice.”The strongest scenes in the picture are intimate exchanges, shot in close-up, between Ms. Tristan and the engaging Ms. Tarnow; Ms. Tarnow’s interactions with Jeff Puckett, who plays a family friend, are similarly attention-getting. But the fact that the film’s most resonant and likable portions are those in which nothing actually happens almost too nicely encapsulates why “The Looking Glass” falls sadly flat throughout much of its running time.
