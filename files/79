Invincible
7.1
AdvertisementBy JEANNETTE CATSOULISEvery two years the sports-underdog movie has become  an event for Walt Disney Pictures, whose Battling inexperience, hostile teammates and an excess of slow-motion photography, Vince is soon being pummeled in summer training and body-slammed in a losing game against the Dallas Cowboys. As Jackson Browne mopes on the soundtrack and the football fans wilt in the stands, Vince’s embittered dad, Frank (Kevin Conway), cautions against optimism. “A man can only take so much failure,” he warns. Recognizing that the same is true of movie audiences, Disney piles on the uplift on and off the field.Yet “Invincible” counters its predictably inspirational trajectory with close attention to historical detail and blue-collar hardship. While a national energy crisis and the ghost of  Vietnam tug at the fringes of the story, the director and cinematographer, Ericson Core, focuses on the stained wallpaper in Vince’s apartment and the dingy camaraderie of the neighborhood bar. He understands that to the beleaguered working class in mid-1970’s Philadelphia, Vince’s story holds out hope for much more than just a winning game.“Invincible” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested).
