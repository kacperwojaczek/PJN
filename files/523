Taken 3
6.0
AdvertisementBy NICOLAS RAPOLDAfter “Non-Stop,” “Unknown” and three installments of the In But there’s little story to speak of, beyond Mr. Neeson’s racing around fighting for the truth, pursued by a Los Angeles detective (Forest Whitaker).A running fantasy of wronged divorced-dad nobility, the series here continues its ritualized plot points. Mr. Neeson babies Kimmy with a childish gift and balks at some completely normal step in her adulthood. He has a barbecue with the fellas (also veterans of covert ops). He makes a very serious cellphone call or two, announcing that someone is being taken, or giving very clear directions. He becomes a righteous fugitive whose rampages (up to and including waterboarding) are rationalized through fatherhood.More important, Mr. Megaton’s direction of action sequences borders on atrocious. Ragged camerawork and editing ruin freeway car chases and hand-to-hand combat alike.The logy screenplay, by Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen, sags under head-clutchingly banal dramatic scenes. Only Mr. Neeson’s appeal somehow survives unscathed, perhaps the most impressive stunt of all.Advertisement“Taken 3” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Intense violence and action, and brief strong language.
