The Wanted 18

AdvertisementBy KEN JAWOROWSKIThe All because of a herd of cows.“Stop-motion animation, interviews and re-enactments are employed throughout this documentary, directed by Paul Cowan and Amer Shomali. It’s a clever mixture, and a funny one as the film evokes the farcical and frightening aspects of the time. In several scenes, the cartoon cows comment on their predicaments and on the humans around them.Ultimately, the tale is just a minor anecdote about resistance; it’s no surprise that the documentary was initially planned as a short film. Even at 75 minutes, it can feel padded with footage whose connection to the central plot is tenuous.But at its best, “The Wanted 18” follows a worthy tradition of highlighting absurdities that arise during conflict: here, Israelis threatened by livestock and Palestinians creating some blunders of their own. To those involved, it seems comical in retrospect. Yet at the time, one Palestinian man says, “we took this cow thing very seriously.”
