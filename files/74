Short Stay
5.8
AdvertisementBy STEPHEN HOLDENOf the many words that might describe Mike (Mike Maccherone), the protagonist of Ted Fendt’s dour, poker-faced comedy, It’s not that Mike, a glum, socially awkward young man who lives with his mother in western New Jersey, doesn’t have work. But it’s the kind that leads nowhere and barely puts change in his pocket. As Mike goes through the motions of life, he displays neither ambition nor enthusiasm. When first encountered, he is making deliveries for a pizza parlor. His routine existence is given a small jolt when an old high school friend, Mark (Mark Simmons), invites Mike to stay in his Philadelphia apartment while Mark goes to Poland for several months. During Mark’s absence, Mike agrees to fill in for him in a dead-end job leading free walking tours of the city.The work isn’t challenging. All that’s required is to stand on a street corner carrying a placard until he has rounded up a few tourists whom he then regales with anecdotes as they traipse around the city. But Mike has no flair for storytelling.Stylistically and tonally, “Short Stay,” As it drags along, the movie makes you feel trapped in the shoes of someone destined for failure. The closest thing to a conflict arises when Mark returns from Poland and asks Mike to move out and give him back his job, and Mike resists. He crashes in the apartments of acquaintances and in the saddest image sleeps on a kitchen floor. It is no way to live.
