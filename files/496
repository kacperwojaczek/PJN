The Calling
5.8
AdvertisementBy BEN KENIGSBERGAs head of a police station in a small town in Ontario, Hazel Micallef (Susan Sarandon) doesn’t see many murders. When two victims turn up in close succession — one nearly decapitated, the other’s disgorged stomach gnawed at by dogs in the snow — Hazel assumes, to paraphrase Marge Gunderson from the film “The Calling,”Donald Sutherland plays the priest who helps Hazel’s investigation, cheerfully expounding on Latin phraseology and the profound faith of early Christian mystics. Preposterous as it is, “The Calling” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Violence, gore, alcohol abuse.
