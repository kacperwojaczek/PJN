AdvertisementBy BEN KENIGSBERG“Mifune: The Last Samurai”A preview of the film.It is also a biography, somewhat incongruously narrated by a sedate Keanu Reeves.The director, Steven Okazaki, talks to Mifune collaborators like the actress Kyoko Kagawa and Kanzo Uni, a sword-fight choreographer whom Mr. Mifune is said to have “killed” more than 100 times. The actress Terumi Niki discusses how Mr. Mifune coaxed performances out of his co-stars during the filming of “Red Beard.”But the film’s richest insights are into Mr. Mifune’s longtime partnership with Akira Kurosawa. As the film tells it, that otherwise exacting director accorded his apparently fearless star unusual leeway. Teruyo Nogami, Kurosawa’s frequent script supervisor, recalls how in the violent finale of “Throne of Blood,” the archers shooting arrows at Mifune were college students and not especially good shots.Emphasizing samurai movies, this documentary mostly skips contemporary-set dramas like “The Bad Sleep Well” and “High and Low.” As for why Kurosawa and Mifune didn’t work together in later years, Martin Scorsese, another interviewee and no stranger to career-long collaborations, suggests that sometimes two artists “use each other up.”
