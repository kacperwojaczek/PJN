Meet the Spartans
2.7
AdvertisementBy JEANNETTE CATSOULISSo much has been written about the homoeroticism in the film In As redundant and tasteless as Queen Margo’s crab-infested chastity belt, “Meet the Spartans” is best described by the reactions of a row of what appeared to be sixth graders who shared the screening with me. As various Spartans slipped one another the tongue (Eewwww!), a nipple clamp was ripped off with the nipple still attached (Aaarghh!) and the Spartans skipped into battle singing  “Meet the Spartans” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has flying dentures, a flatulent penguin and human testicles smeared with dog food.MEET THE SPARTANSOpened on Friday nationwide.
