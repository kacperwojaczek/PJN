The new Frank is played by the reedy and humorless Ed Skrein, who substitutes smarm for Mr. Statham’s deadpan wit. Comic relief has been delegated to a new character, his dad (Ray Stevenson), a retired spy, who addresses his son as “junior,” a dynamic borrowed from “Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.”Frank’s latest client is Anna (Loan Chabanol), who hires him for a robbery in Monte Carlo. Sold into prostitution when she was 12, Anna now vamps about with former co-workers on a revenge quest inspired by the Three Musketeers. (Their use of blond wigs for capers seems patterned after Brian De Palma films.)“The Transporter Refueled” is crass and nonsensical, but it is hard to hate a movie in which a medical anesthetic is administered with a nightclub fog machine, the weapons include a ringed life preserver, an escape from a moving plane continues by car onto a jetway and the touch-screen banking software appears expressly designed for double-crossing.“The Transporter Refueled” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Reckless driving.
