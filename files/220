Spectre

AdvertisementBy MANOHLA DARGISDoes it mean something that James Bond drinks a dirty martini in “Spectre,” the latest in the seemingly unkillable franchise? It’s too soon to know, though true Bondologists will be parsing this new drink’s significance shortly. As more of an amateur in all-things Bond, I had hoped a dirty bomb would go boom or that the actress Léa Seydoux would do something unspeakable to Daniel Craig, given that the pre-credit sequence features female nudes writhing alongside an octopus with busy arms. Part of the bankable pleasure of the series, after all, is that every so often, among the usual guns and girls, the unexpected happens — a bikini stops the film, a villain revs it up, Bond surprises.
                A ranking of the most popular films in the James Bond franchise, based on how much they pulled in at the box office.            There’s nothing surprising in “Spectre,” the 24th “official” title in the series, which is presumably as planned. Much as the perfect is the enemy of good, originality is often the enemy of the global box office. And so, for the fourth time, Mr. Craig has suited up to play the British spy who’s saving the world one kill at a time, with Sam Mendes occupying the director’s chair for a second turn. They’re a reasonable fit, although their joint seriousness has started to feel more reflexive than honest, especially because every Bond movie inevitably shakes off ambition to get down to the blockbuster business of hurling everything — bodies, bullets, fireballs, debris, money — at the screen.
                Always big dreamers, Bond villains come in many flavors.            Before that happens here, there’s the usual narrative busywork that plays as if it were written by committee, which it was (John Logan, Neal Purvis, Robert Wade and Jez Butterworth). If you have watched one Bond movie, you know the score. The band — M (Ralph Fiennes), Moneypenny (Naomie Harris) and Q (Ben Whishaw) — gets back together, with Bond singing lead. There’s an opening lollapalooza blowout that Mr. Mendes largely delivers in one long silky take, having clearly studied trends in contemporary art cinema. Mr. Craig and the camera move together beautifully in this sequence, whether Bond’s sauntering across a roof (and in what has become a signature, adjusting a shirt cuff) or riding down a collapsing building as easily as you would a slide at a water park.The Times critic Manohla Dargis reviews “Spectre.”There’s more, of course, including car chases, nominally exotic locales and a pulpy, visceral slugfest on a passenger train with a Bluto-size hurting machine (Dave Bautista) who’s evocative of that old Bond enemy A preview of the film.Back in 2006, Mr. Craig slipped into “Casino Royale” and the role of James Bond like a middleweight’s fist in a boxing glove, bringing to the gig a battered beauty one punch away from ugly, a powerful chest that looks good in a tux and a visceral predatory quality that works equally well for annihilating villains and ladies. Mr. Craig was the right Bond for a moment still haunted by Sept. 11: He looked roughed up, possibly cruel and ready to fight. That Mr. Craig could also deliver layered emotional intensity and unexpected expressive delicacy was a nice bonus for a series that sprang back with deadly solemnity and scarcely a trace of the playfulness, much less the campy joie de vivre, that’s mostly associated with the Roger Moore era. “I miss Roger Moore,” a friend recently sighed.AdvertisementI don’t, with sincere apologies to Sir Roger. I like Mr. Craig’s Bond a lot, but I am also still pining for Sean Connery, the production designer Mr. Craig delivers the blows — the crushing uppercuts and sucker punches — more persuasively than the chaste kisses, although given the anemic seductresses Bond is often now paired with, the actor can scarcely take the blame. A few sashay through “Spectre,” most agreeably AdvertisementIn 1966, Kingsley Amis attributed the success of the Bond stories partly to what he called the “Fleming effect,” noting how Bond’s fantastic world, “as well as the temporary, local, fantastic elements,” are “ ‘bolted down’ to some sort of reality.” The Bond movies have always managed to tap into reality by switching on a camera, a connection to the material world that lingered no matter how far out the villains, their wild lairs and intrigues. The current Bond team is trying to keep the audience entertained with new tricks and gizmos while keeping it kind of real, which perhaps explains why this Bond sweats buckets, tears up and even bares his feelings. Mr. Craig is very good at selling Bond’s humanity, though in truth, what has always really turned us on isn’t 007’s humanity but the reverse.“Spectre” is rated PG-13. (Parents strongly cautioned.) Kiss, kiss, kablooey. Running time: 2 hours 28 minutes.
