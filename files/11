Ice Age: Collision Course

AdvertisementBy GLENN KENNYThe woolly mammoth couple Manny and Ellie contend with possible empty-nest syndrome and a possibly nest-destroying asteroid in “The key attributes of the movie, which is directed by Galen T. Chu and Mike Thurmeier, are undemanding and audience-approved. Anthropomorphized prehistoric cartoon animals spout endless contemporary-culture-allusive wisecracks (“You look nothing like your profile picture,” “Hashtag hashtag hashtag,” etc., and ad infinitum), alternating with Hollywood-standard family-values twaddle that is as facile as it is insincerely expressed. Hence, the movie’s actual entertainment value rises considerably during the dialogue-free sequences, most of which involve a manic squirrel, Scrat, chasing his coveted acorn into a spaceship initially encased in a glacier. He inadvertently launches the spacecraft, and flies around in a way that reorders the known universe.A preview of the film.“Road Runner”-style gags recycled in computer-smooth 3-D animation still pack some punch, as it happens. A scene in which an electrical storm menaces the movie’s protagonists also generates some visual interest.The wide-ranging celebrity cast of voice talent here makes room for the astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson as a version of himself, and Adam Devine as Manny and Ellie’s would-be son-in-law, Julian, who repeatedly refers to Manny as “Bro Dad,” a habit that is precisely as unendearing as it sounds. Eagle-eyed parents can rest easy; the role of Peaches, the object of Julian’s affections, is voiced by Keke Palmer, not the eponymous raunchy performing artist. I consider this a missed opportunity. GLENN KENNY“Ice Age: Collision Course” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested) for anthropomorphized prehistoric cartoon animal body-function humor, mostly.
