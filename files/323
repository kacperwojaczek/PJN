Two robbers (James Landry Hébert and Michael Villar) botch a bank heist and take a bystander named Vivian (Ashley Bell) with them when they flee.But that’s just a sideshow. The felons blunder into the domain of a former military sniper (Pat Healy) who is still pretty good with a rifle. He has apparently been doing unspeakable things to people who come his way for some time. It’s “Deliverance” for the midnight-movie set, juxtaposing eerie silence and noisy slaughter.Mr. Keating
