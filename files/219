The Expendables 3
6.1
AdvertisementBy NICOLAS RAPOLDWalking past Madame Tussauds after a preview screening of Sylvester Stallone again leads a lineup of distinguished colleagues, and soon enough he’s rounding up a younger batch of killers for a mission against a nemesis long thought dead (energetically played by Mel Gibson, whose career has been in a similar state). When the youngsters are detained in the villain’s lair amid far-flung postwar ruins, Mr. Stallone and his originals save the whippersnappers by shooting stuff and making strategic quips.The director, Patrick Hughes, pours these gunfire barrages, explosions and a few leaping stunts into rambling set pieces, as if turning an action hose on and off. A little pizazz comes from Antonio Banderas as a gabby Spanish killer and from Wesley Snipes as a loose cannon, reconfirming his potent screen presence. Harrison Ford gets an extended grimacing turn as a government agent, and Arnold Schwarzenegger plays a big friendly guy who turns up occasionally to hang out.It’s all a bit like a classic-rock tribute concert, or playing with all your action figures at once, or maybe “The Expendables 3” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for action stars going about their business.
