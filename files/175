The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor

AdvertisementBy STEPHEN HOLDENThe The third installment, “Tomb of the Dragon Emperor,” directed by Rob Cohen (When the curse is accidentally lifted, the emperor,  joined by a rebel Chinese army, rushes to the Himalayas, where a dip in a pool in Shangri-La promises immortality. He already has supernatural powers and likes to turn himself into a three-headed dragon. Accompanying the O’Connells is Evelyn’s eccentric, wisecracking brother Jonathan (John Hannah), who during the flight to the mountains is vomited on by a yak.The kindest thing to be said for this frantic, cluttered mess of cheesy computer-generated action-adventure clichés is that at least you can see how the estimated $175 million budget (according to the Internet Movie Database) was spent. We get an avalanche, an army of bow-and-arrow-wielding skeletons, a car chase that turns into a fireworks explosion, and a cadre of snowy yetis. In  the movie’s futile drive to conjure visceral excitement, the action sequences are edited into an incoherent jumble that makes you feel trapped on a rickety airplane sitting in a pool of yak vomit.“The  Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some strong language and mild violence.THE MUMMYTomb of the Dragon EmperorOpens on Friday nationwide. Directed by AdvertisementWITH:
