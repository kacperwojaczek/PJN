Dirty Grandpa
6.0
AdvertisementBy NICOLAS RAPOLDDan Mazer’s crude, mindless “Mr. De Niro plays Dick, the horny, foul-mouthed grandfather of a corporate lawyer, Jason (Most of the comedy is along the lines of phallic graffiti on a subway poster. You can’t question Mr. De Niro’s commitment, however: In one of many scenes played for shock value, he does a surprised-while-masturbating gag. Years of talking blue streaks in Martin Scorsese movies make him a natural for playing this alpha-male senior.The screenplay, by John M. Phillips, is the written equivalent of a toddler discovering curse words. Yet some riffs draw chuckles: Aubrey Plaza reaches some personal seventh heaven trading aggressive come-ons with Mr. De Niro; Jason Mantzoukas thrives as a flagrant drug dealer; and as Jason’s strait-laced dad, Dermot Mulroney does a lot with a little deadpan delivery.Heart-to-heart chats between Dick and his fuming grandson arrive on cue, as if in a straight family comedy. These get dirty, since Grandpa’s involved, and the absurd whiplash between sentiment and filth suggests a parody of the genre. This is probably done on purpose, which actually helps the movie, but, unfortunately, so are the lazily vulgar gags, which don’t.“Dirty Grandpa” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Torrents of profanity, with graphic nudity and drugs.
