Yes Man
6.8
AdvertisementBy A. O. SCOTTAt the beginning of But “Yes Man,” dutifully directed by Peyton Reed (Most of us learned at least a rudimentary version of this lesson around the age of  5, and one of the many problems with “Yes Man” is that it is insufficiently infantile. Mr. Carrey looks too grown up, too tired to plunge into the reckless silliness that the story demands, and the story doesn’t really demand enough of it. Once Carl has banished no from his vocabulary, what does he say yes to? Flying lessons. A class in conversational Korean. Every loan application that crosses his desk.That last bit has a somewhat unpleasant, if inadvertent, topical resonance, but never mind that. Some of the things Carl does are a bit wilder than learning to play the guitar. He accepts a sexual proposition from an elderly neighbor, which leads to a gag that was already tired when it popped up in And he falls in love with a pale-eyed, mildly eccentric cutie named Allison, played by Zooey Deschanel, who took on similar waif duties opposite Will Ferrell in Mr. Carrey has some good moments, as do a few of the supporting performers, notably Bradley Cooper as Carl’s best friend and Rhys Darby as his socially maladroit boss. But “Yes Man” rarely rises to genuine hilarity. It takes no risks, finds no inspiration and settles, like its hero, into a dull, noncommittal middle ground. Should you see this movie? Maybe. Whatever. I don’t care.Advertisement“Yes Man” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some swearing, sexual references and brief nudity.
