Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb
N/A
AdvertisementBy NICOLAS RAPOLDA scene from the film.“Night at the Museum 3: Secret of the Tomb” signifies closing time for the franchise in which exhibits come alive, and Ben Stiller has to deal with them. The director, Shawn Levy, and the new writers, David Guion and Michael Handelman, throw together enough gags and one-liners to ensure a diverting and, here and there, rather funny journey for the museum stalwart Larry and his menagerie of Teddy Roosevelt, a miniature Roman general, a Neanderthal, a capuchin monkey and others.Now director of nighttime operations, Larry (Mr. Stiller, near left) must visit a pharaoh (Ben Kingsley!) in the British Museum to learn why Roosevelt and friends went bonkers during a dinner show at the American Museum of Natural History. The problems center on an enchanted Egyptian tablet tied to the animation of the exhibits. The trip introduces new blood to the comedy, chiefly a revived Sir Lancelot (a sharp Dan Stevens, far left) and a gabby British nightwatchwoman (Rebel Wilson), and Larry’s travails with his college-averse son yield lessons about independence.The premise shares something with durable silent-era slapstick yarns, even if the material underserves Mr. Stiller, Ricky Gervais, Steve Coogan and the other comedians. (As Roosevelt, Robin Williams serves more as a benevolent fatherly presence.) But the writers turn out amusing riffs on how historical figures might react to the present, nice bits of business (like a tumble into an Escher painting) and a passable It’s a chronically underachieving movie, but relatively amusing in its quaint wish fulfillment.Rated PG (Parental guidance suggested) for the wild rumpus to be expected from a museum coming alive.
