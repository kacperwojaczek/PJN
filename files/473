AdvertisementBy JEANNETTE CATSOULISWhen a movie character’s last name is synonymous with “fuse,” the audience will be wondering when to expect his meltdown. In Brilliant in its simplicity, the setup of His journey may be a movie staple, but its execution here is near flawless. Herding great actors into small roles, the director, Chad Stahelski (a seasoned stunt man directing for the first time), wisely capitalizes on their experience and skills: Willem Dafoe as John’s shady mentor; John Leguizamo as a chop-shop owner, bringing real subtlety to an all-too-brief scene; a formidable Ian McShane, parked in a gleaming bad-guy hotel like a menacing pasha; and the marvelous Michael Nyqvist, who plays the mob boss with more dignity and nuance than Derek Kolstad’s silly script deserves.Filming in New York City and Rockland County, Mr. Stahelski (who was Mr. Reeves’s stunt double in “And then there’s Mr. Reeves, always more comfortable in roles that demand cool over hot, attitude over emotion. Never at ease as one of a pack or as a romantic lead, he’s a loner with a dancer’s walk (from the hips, not the knees) and a physical charisma that the camera locks on to. Here, costumed in an indestructible three-piece suit, he’s the perfect locus for the film’s hyper-real savagery, the drain that everyone will eventually circle.Infused with codes and totems — like the dog collar and bracelet carefully aligned on John’s bedside table — “John Wick” conjures a natty netherworld of lethal temperaments and impeccable tailoring. John’s quest may be one-note, but that note could not be more perfectly pitched.Advertisement“John Wick” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Mangled humans and a battered beagle.
