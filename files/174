Sent to the Glade for mysterious reasons, a messianic figure, Thomas (Dylan O’Brien), discovers that the changing maze can be used against the Grievers.Whatever cataclysm has ailed society has inspired the cinematographer to bathe everything in bluish gray. The Grievers’ limbs tumble over one another in an indistinct mash of menace. The dime store explanations are unsatisfying, but the movie does its main job: raising curiosity for a sequel. Problem solved.“The Maze Runner” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Fearmongering, giant spiders.
