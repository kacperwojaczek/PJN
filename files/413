AdvertisementBy RACHEL SALTZ“Directed by Shakun Batra, the movie starts as a comedy of family dysfunction. Dadu, who enjoys playacting his death, has a real heart attack. That brings home — to That older generation has its own agita. Papa (Rajat Kapoor, but not one of those Kapoors) has money trouble, and all signs point to him having an affair. Mama (Ratna Pathak) is restless and angry.Mr. Batra, whose previous films include “That’s a tribute to its actors, who make their characters’ wounds palpable but don’t play them too broadly. (Rishi Kapoor, though, has a high old hammy time as the pot-smoking, porn-approving, a-little-too-cute Dadu.) It’s also a tribute to Mr. Batra and Ayesha Devitre Dhillon, with whom he wrote the script. They know how to press the story without pressing it too hard.It helps that the movie plays against expectations, if gently. The foreign-returned grandsons here aren’t swaggering wheeler-dealers in need of lessons about humility and home. They’re writers who need to repair relations with their family. Rahul’s secret is also a bit unusual for Hindi movies, and though you may guess it early, it plays out in a mostly satisfying way. When I saw the movie, the audience rewarded it with Bollywood’s gold standard of approval: tears, and a few hoots.Advertisement“Kapoor &amp; Sons — Since 1921” is not rated.
