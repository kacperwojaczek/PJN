The Hills Have Eyes 2
7.0
AdvertisementBy MATT ZOLLER SEITZWes Craven’s  1977 film, Written by Mr. Craven and his son, Jonathan, and directed by Martin Weisz (of the cannibal-themed “Rohtenburg”), the film is brazenly indebted to old cowboys-and-Indians movies and to James Cameron’s One man-versus-mutant dust-up ends with a sledgehammer to the groin. Enough said. “The Hills Have Eyes 2” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes profanity, graphic gunplay, rapes, dripping brain matter, lopped-off limbs, a French kiss by a mutant tongue, gynecological close-ups of a mutant birth and enough drool to fill Shamu’s tank at Sea World.
