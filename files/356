We trace her youth, so often cruel, through that place and St. Louis, and later watch as she uses art to discover herself.Footage of her singing and acting will be most eye-opening for those who regard Ms. Angelou as only a writer; recollections by her and other performers of the landmark play Though her friendships with Malcolm X and James Baldwin are detailed, other relationships, including those with former husbands, feel glossed over. And late scenes that revel in her fame have a promotional quality; the heart of this film lies in drawing inspiration from her early accomplishments, not in hearing from so many celebrities.Nevertheless, the directors, Bob Hercules and Rita Coburn Whack, are always enthusiastic about their subject, and who can blame them. It’s hard not to be inspired by a life this well lived.
