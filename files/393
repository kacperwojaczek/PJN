Hitman: Agent 47

AdvertisementBy JEANNETTE CATSOULISDumb as dirt and just as generic, But do we really need another movie about a man who’s a “perfect killing machine”? Or another evil corporation dreaming about cloning him into an army? Mr. Bach and his backers clearly believe that we do, going so far as to reboot the 2007 headache A genetically-engineered, elite assassin known only as Agent 47 becomes conflicted by his conscience and unfamiliar emotions.Blasting through Singapore and Berlin, Agent 47 (Mr. Friend) and his nemesis, John Smith (Mr. Quinto), are aces at slaying but not so great at dying, popping up like But formula demands a (preferably beautiful) woman in peril, and so we have Katia (Hannah Ware), whom we meet holed up in a Berlin library. She’s looking for her father (poor Ciaran Hinds), Agent 47 is looking for her, and Smith is looking for both of them. One wants to kill her and the other wants to protect her, and kudos to you if you can work out which is which. (Maybe the movie’s continuity issues aren’t confined to Katia’s on-again, off-again lipstick.)A grab bag of random notions lifted primarily from the “Terminator” and “Matrix” universes, “Hitman” is a sexless, virtually bloodless chain of preposterous battles rendered in a two-dimensional gloss. But it will almost certainly be back: There are currently seven installments of the video game, with an eighth on the way. Though if they return with a steamy romance between Smith and 47, I might be forced to buy a ticket.“Hitman: Agent 47” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Lethal tailoring and a deadly asthma inhaler.
