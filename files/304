A Brave Heart: The Lizzie Velasquez Story
7.2
AdvertisementBy KEN JAWOROWSKIThe makers of Lizzie Velasquez was born with a rare syndrome that prevents her from gaining weight. From birth, her illness altered her features and left her body stick thin. Now 26, she weighs about 63 pounds.Despite the disfiguring effects of the disease and some ostracization in grade school, she grew up happily. At 17, “I was on the high road,” she says.Then the Internet found her.While doing homework she came across a YouTube page titled “The World’s Ugliest Woman.” She clicked on it: Someone had posted a video of her, and hundreds of vicious comments had been written. The anonymous taunting intensified, leading her to film her own videos, dedicated to acceptance. A Sara Hirsh Bordo, directing her first feature, keeps the scenes bright and fast-moving, but several important topics — Ms. Velasquez’s health, her deeper emotions, her college years — are barely addressed. The film also stirs up an intense urge to see at least one Internet troll tracked down and confronted, an opportunity not taken here.One day, as Ms. Velasquez is about to speak before a crowd of 10,000, she receives another hate-filled message. It’s a searing scene that makes you want to rush to her aid. Yet for all this dauntless woman can teach us, it’s clear we need her help far more than she needs ours.Advertisement“A Brave Heart: The Lizzie Velasquez Story” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). An absurd rating if it keeps away the young people who most need to hear these harsh descriptions of bullying.
