Killers
5.4
AdvertisementBy JEANNETTE CATSOULISTwo nut cases, one Japanese and the other Indonesian, work out their psychoses on innocent women and despicable men in the aptly named “Playing Nomura, a Tokyo lounge lizard with a well-stocked basement torture chamber, Kazuki Kitamura has a bored loucheness that’s darkly magnetic. But dousing women with acid and uploading videos of his “artworks” to the Internet isn’t the thrill that it used to be. So when an online encounter with Bayu (Oka Antara), an unhinged Jakarta journalist, suggests a kindred spirit, Nomura wonders if mentoring might be the answer to his ennui.At heart a repulsive slash-and-bash with philosophical pretensions, “Killers” is classed up considerably by strong acting, a multi-strand plot and a tone that’s both nihilistic and mournful. Neither the cinematographer, Gunnar Nimpuno, nor the directors seem excited by carnage: Some of the bloodiest moments are also the dreamiest. When things are jacked up — in a shootout inside a car, for instance, or when Bayu is chased by a posse of heavies — Mr. Nimpuno shoves his camera into the fray with such gusto that he almost certainly has the bruises to prove it.Though hardly immune to cliché (Nomura nibbles on raw meat and listens to classical music like Hannibal Lecter), this squirmy tale of dueling addictions gets points for skillful spikes of humor. In one of these, two cops confer outside a nightclub while, in the background, Nomura wrestles a semiconscious prostitute back into his trunk. The scene has a slapstick energy that leavens the sleaze; just don’t expect to leave the theater laughing.
